1. Create a separate file called `app` with the extension `.js`
2. Within the `.js` file, add some JavaScript code.
3. Link to the separate .js file within the HTML file you
   created in Practice exercise 1.2.
4. Open the HTML file within your browser and check to see whether the
JavaScript code ran properly.

app.js
```
alert("Beware the winter advisory warning.");
prompt("How many jackets will you wear?");
```

index.html
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <title>Sample</title>
    <script src="app.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Sample Title</h1>
    <p>Sample Text</p>
  </body>
</html>
```


4. Code could not be ineffective.
