### Create variables for three numbers: a, b, and c.
    Update these variables with the following actions using the assignment operators:

* Add `b` to `a`
* Divide `a` by `c`
* Roplace the value of `c` with the modulus of `c` and `b`
* Print all three numbres to the console.

```
let a = 300;
let b = 20;
let c = 30;
a /= c;
c %= b;
console.log(a, b, c);
```
