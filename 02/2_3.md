### Write some code to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle using the Pythagorean
theorem when given the values of the other two sides.

You can use prompt() to get the value for a and b. Write code to get the value from
the user for a and b. Then square the values of both a and b before adding them
together and finding the square root. Print your answer to the console.

```
const a = prompt("Short leg of triangle");
const b = prompt("Long leg of triangle");
const c = Math.sqrt(a ** 2 + b ** 2);
console.log("The hypotenuse is:", c);
```
